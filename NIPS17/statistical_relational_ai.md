# Statistical Relational AI
because different types are inference are possible for complex systems AI

relational prob models: predicate logic extens propositional logic to more general situations -> + probability => sth like graphical models

## Probabilistic Logic Programs
directed graph models + prog languages (is it like constrained prob prog?)

probLog -> probabilistic prob in logic
* allows to write a program as a set of rules (predicates)
* rules, or transition between states can be probabilistic)
* we need to specify probilities of events and rules on those events;
* we can easily get marginals or conditionals

Sounds a lot like directed graphical models with discrete (binary) random variables.
