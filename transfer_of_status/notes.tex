\section{Notes}

General theme: Representation learning for sequential data.\\

I'm interested in:
\begin{itemize}
	\item timeseries
	\item unsupervised learning
	\item predictive coding
	\item learning abstract concept and ideas
\end{itemize}

What I'd like to do is:\\
I'd like to leverage unsupervised learning for time-series to learn abstract concepts that describe the world, and more importantly, its evolution. I would like to be able to:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item predict how the world evolves
	\item find out whether doing so in a probabilistic way has any benefits over deterministic approaches, e.g. is multi-modality of a probabilistic solution helpful
	\item see how imposing structure on the predictions affects representation learning, e.g. air-style unsupervised object tracking; using a policy to either minimise or maximise surprise to improve learning speed, predictive accuracy or both
\end{itemize}
