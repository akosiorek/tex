\section{conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

    This paper summarises the contributions I have made during my DPhil studies so far and details my future research plan. For the remainder of my studies I would like to explore representation learning for videos, with the focus on next-frame prediction by using models that impose a problem-specific structure. Finally, I would like to investigate the applicability of proposed solutions for model learning for model-based reinforcement learning.
